# Hash_Table
Hash table implementation using different collision strategy like 
Chaining, Linear probing, Double Hashing, Quadratic Probabing 
and implementation of different hash function like
mudolo hashing, Mids square base10 hashing, Mid square base2 hashing, Multiplicative hashing, and Adler-32 Hashing.
